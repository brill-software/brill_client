    <h1>The Brill CMS supports the development of real-time e-commerce and e-learning websites</h1>

    <h2>Brill CMS</h2>
    <p>An application is composed of pages, with each page composed of components. The components make use of various
        resources which are also part of the application. The pages and often resources are encoded in JSON. The Brill
        CMS supports editing pages and resources that comprise an application. </p>
    <p>Pages can be edited using a JSON or WYSIWYG editor. The JSON editor is more suited to developers that want to
        know exactly what the page structure is and the attributes that are passed to components. The WYSISYG editor is
        more suited to business users and content developers that want to concentrate on the page appearance, rather
        than the underlying technical details. Users can easily switch between the different edit modes.</p>
    <p>To use the CMS, the user needs to login. The user is presented with a list of applications that they own or have
        permission to access. The user can also create a new application or copy an existing application.</p>
    <p>Once an application is selected for editing, there&rsquo;s a tree on the left hand side with the pages, files and
        directory structure. The user can select a page or file to edit. With pages, there are number of different edit
        modes. Files are edited using a text editor with syntax colour highlighting. The CMS supports both a dark theme
        and light theme.</p>
    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <p>A Theme allows a consistent set of colours, fonts and styling to be applied across an application. Normally a
        Theme will be developed that matches the organisations style guide for colours, fonts and layout. This can then
        be applied across all the organisations applications.</p>
    <p>Most of the Brill Components are based on Material UI components. There&rsquo;s a default Material UI Theme which
        is documented at:</p>
    <p><a
            href="https://material-ui.com/customization/default-theme/">https://material-ui.com/customization/default-theme/</a>
    </p>
    <p>The MUI Theme has been extended to support some additional fields. The <code>override</code> section can be used
        to override Brill Components, as well as MUI Components. There are also two additional sections that allow the
        styles of the &lt;html&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags to be specified.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a Theme file.</p>

    },

        "h1": {
            "font": "sans-serif",
            "fontSize": "1.5rem",
            "@media (min-width:700px)": {
                "fontSize": "2rem"
            },

            "button": {
                "padding": "8px 8px 4px 8px"

            "bar": {
                "width": "100%",
                "height": "5px", 
                "background": "red"
            }
        },
    }
    "body": {
        "style": {
            "margin": "0px",
            "minWidth": "320px",
        }
    }

    <p>It sets the primary colour for use by MUI Components. The &lt;h1&gt; styling is specified for both large screens
        and small screens. The styling for the MenuButton components is specified and also the styling for the page
        &lt;body&gt; tag.</p>
    <p>Best practice is to use themes for styling. You can however set the style of an individual component using the
        <code>style</code> attribute. This is useful where a component requires a slightly different style from that
        specified in the theme.
    </p>
    <h2>Material UI Components</h2>
    <p>Most of the Brill UI components are based on Material-UI components. Material-UI is an open source framework that
        implements Google&rsquo;s Material Design. It's the world's most popular React UI framework.</p>
    <p>Custom components can be developed using other frameworks such as Semantic-UI if there&rsquo;s a requirement to
        do so.</p>
    <h2>Component Palette</h2>
    <p>The Component Palette contains components that can be dragged and dropped onto the page. The Component Palette
        can be customised to add or remove particular components. This is useful to provide Page Editors with the
        components that just match the organisations style guide. Custom developed components can be added to the
        palette and the defaults for various attributes set.</p>
    <h2>Media Library</h2>
    <p>The library is shared across applications and holds images, themes, templates and other resources that could be
        useful. Images and themes can be copied from the library into an application. Library items can be hidden so
        that just the items that match the organisations style guide are displayed.</p>
    <h2>Page Templates</h2>
    <p>A set of template pages is provided to support quick page creation. Additional templates can be added. Templates
        can also be hidden. Pages can include common sections for items like headers and footers.</p>
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>A users has to be granted access to edit an application by the application owner. The application owner is the
        user that originally created the application. Ownership can be transferred to another user and also shared.</p>
    <p>An application owner has full read-write access to the application and can publish a new version of the
        application. An application owner can grant access to other users. The levels that can be granted are:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">Application Owner</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">Publish rights</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">Full read/write access</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">Editing of text and image components only</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">Read only access but with ability to add comments</p>
    <h2>Git repository</h2>
    <p>All application files are held in a <em>git</em> repository. Best practice is to use a MASTER branch, which is
        the Production branch and a DEVELOPMENT branch. Changes are made and tested on the DEVELOPMENT branch and when
        ready, merged into the MASTER branch. Changes are not normally made on the MASTER branch. The history of all
        files can be viewed. When changes are saved, the user is prompted to enter a description of the change. The
        description is saved in <em>git</em>.</p>
