    <h1>Brill CMS - used for creating real-time e-commerce and e-learning web sites using React Components and a Spring
        Boot Java server</h1>

    <h2>Brill Software</h2>
    <p>Brill Software is a start-up company that is developing a CMS and Framework for creating real-time transactional
        and e-commerce web sites. Real-time means pages are updated immediately. Transactional websites are ones where
        the user performs a transaction such as transferring money between bank accounts or booking a vaccination. The
        CMS and Framework are aimed at developers and organisations that wish to develop their own Intranet and Internet
        sites and also companies that develop websites for other people.</p>
    <h3>What&rsquo;s different with the Brill CMS?</h3>
    <p>Most CMS are used for creating static web sites, sometimes with an ability to support custom plug-ins. The Brill
        CMS was built from day one to support the development of real-time web sites that interact with databases and
        external systems. The Brill CMS provides a set of components for constructing pages but it also allows
        developers to develop and add their own custom components.</p>
    <h3>How can the Brill Framework help reduce costs?</h3>
    <p>Organisations employ large teams of developers on transactional website development at significant cost. The cost
        is high because developers spend a large amount of time writing and testing code. Code is expensive and time
        consuming to produce. Developers also spend time selecting and integrating various technologies.</p>
    <p>The Brill Framework provides a complete &ldquo;low code&rdquo; approach where the coding required is reduced to a
        minimum. Large parts of an application can be created using the CMS. Coding is required for custom components,
        field validation and server side functionality to connect to external systems.</p>
    <p>As well as reducing initial development costs, the Brill CMS also reduces on-going maintenance costs. Many
        changes can be made to a web site without requiring code changes or a software release. Business users are able
        to make changes without the need for IT input. Changes can be published immediately without having to wait for
        the next release date.</p>
    <h3>Is the software Open Source?</h3>
    <p>The full source code for the Brill Framework is available for download, consisting of the React Typescript Client
        code and the Java Spring Boot Server code. The source code is distributed under the MIT license. The MIT license
        is one of the most permissive Open Source licenses. The source code can be used freely in commercial projects.
    </p>
    <p>Not only is the source code provided but it&rsquo;s also documented to a high standard and designed to be easy to
        understand, modify and re-use. There&rsquo;s not a lot of point in having the source code if it&rsquo;s really
        complex and difficult to modify. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve put a lot of effort into the documentation and
        design.</p>
    <p>The communication between the client and server is using a middleware protocol we&rsquo;ve called the Brill
        Middleware. The protocol is fully documented and can be used by anyone. We hope that one day Brill Middleware
        will become the standard for client / server communications using WebSockets, just as REST is the standard for
        HTTP.</p>
    <h3>Where does the company name come from?</h3>
    <p>Brill is short for &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo;. Rather than just develop software that meets the QA standards, we
        want to develop software that&rsquo;s brilliant. Software that is useful, well designed, easy to understand,
        documented, tested and developed to the very highest standards. Software that&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brill
        Software&rdquo;.</p>
    <h3>Is there a SaaS version of the CMS?</h3>
    <p>There&rsquo;s not a SaaS like that provided by Wix or WordPress. A key feature we provide is the ability to
        develop your own custom components and develop server side functionality for connecting to external systems.
        This isn&rsquo;t something that can easily be provided in a shared SaaS environment. You can of course run the
        Brill Server on a cloud service such as Amazon EC2 to save having your own hardware.</p>
    <h3>What technologies does the Brill Framework use?</h3>
    <p>The client code uses React and Typescript. The server is implemented using Java and Spring Boot. Communications
        between the client and server is using Web Sockets and JSON messages. This website was developed using the Brill
        Framework.</p>
