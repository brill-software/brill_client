     * Async method that takes a password and returns a SHA-256 hash. A pepper value is added to the password

     * be used to make passwords unique to a particular server and make sure users/passwords can't be 
     * copied from the Development to Production database.
     * 
     * The purpose of using a hash on the client is to ensure that the server has no knowledge of the users 
     * cleartext password. The server uses the hash as the password. It also prevents web browsers from issuing 
     * warning messages about passwords passed in the clear.

     * @param pwd The password.
     * @returns SHA-256 hash.
